# syscall_anomaly_tracecompass_visualization
This repo contains the script for visualizing the output of the system performance anomaly detection framework. We have converted the model's output to Google's Trace Event format, which Trace Compass can read. This file contains a set of events, each of which is equivalent to an event in the original trace. Our script uses the field category to determine whether the event belonged to a normal or abnormal window. So, make sure to add the appropriate traces. This script is meant to be run with the Jython scripting engine, as it makes an event request on the currently active trace.
